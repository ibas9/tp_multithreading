# Multi-Processing Program

This program demonstrates multi-processing in Python by simulating a manager, boss, and minions working together. To run the program, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Instructions

1. **Open three separate terminals**.

2. **Terminal 1**: Run the manager by executing the following command in the first terminal: python manager.py

3. **Terminal 2**: Run the minion by executing the following command in the second terminal: python minion.py

4. **Terminal 3**: Run the boss by executing the following command in the third terminal: python boss.py

Note on Commit Messages and Labwork Progression:
Initially, in the labwork, we integrated JSON functionalities into our Task.py. However, this feature was initially commented out as our focus at that time was not on testing these functionalities but rather enhancing our initial work by adding print statements for better visibility and diagnostics(especially for Boss.py). Instead of only committing Boss.py, we did a git'add .' so everything was committed with the same title which is "add logging". It's important to note that while the JSON functionality was already present in the code at this point, it remained commented out and inactive because the purpose was to re-test the code without it. Later, I made another commit to activate the JSON functionalities by uncommenting the relevant code sections. This was committed with the message "add JSON functionalities", marking the point where we started utilizing the JSON features in our project.
